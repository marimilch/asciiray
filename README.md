# ASCIIRay

## How to build
In your console, type
```cc asciiray.c -o asciiray```
and press Enter.

## Usage
In your console, type
```./asciiray width height```
and press Enter.
~~160 and 40 is recommended due to least artifacts.~~
The tearing bug has been fixed and any size should work. :)

Enjoy the little demo :).

## Warning
Not a raytracer. The title sucks, lol.
Will not work on not UNIX-based systems.

# Thank you
