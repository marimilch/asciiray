## How to build

In your console, type
```cc asciiray.c -o asciiray```
and press Enter. It does not depend on any library. :)

## Usage
In your console, type
```./asciiray width height```
and press Enter.
~~160 and 40 is recommended due to least artifacts.~~
The tearing bug has been fixed and any size should work. :)

Enjoy the little demo :).

## Warning
Actually not a raytracer, since it works with the camera matrix.
Will not work on not UNIX-based systems, sorry. :(

# Thank you
